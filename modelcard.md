# Model Card for Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews

The model used is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to analyze product reviews and predict whether people are likely to recommend the product or not. 

## Model Details

### Model Description

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a sequential neural network architecture with dropout regularization. It is trained on X% of the dataset, and is designed for opinion analysis and product recommendation prediction. It leverages the structure of text data to capture dependencies and patterns in reviews, allowing it to make binary recommendations based on the sentiment and content of incoming reviews.

- **Demo [optional]:** {{ demo | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

## Uses

The model is designed to analyze customer reviews and comments in order to understand sentiment and determine whether customers are likely to recommend a product positively or not. 

### Direct Use

This is useful for companies to make data-driven decisions, without having to read all the reviews. An idea of the product recommendations will be available and thus be able to make improvements through a global view of all the reviews.

### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

{{ downstream_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model has been trained from reviews, thus there is a subjective opinion in the text.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Bias
- The opinion on a product depends on several subjective aspects that are not covered by the model, such as the size of women.

### Risks


### Limitations 
- The model may be less accurate for text data that is significantly different from the e-commerce reviews it was trained on.
- The model may be less accurate with male review text data, as all instances of the model are female.
- The model has been trained in English, so it does not support the input of text in other languages.
- The model does not interpret emojis.

### Recommendations

The model is recommended for analyzing overall women's trends in customer sentiment and identifying areas for improvement based on customer feedback.
